# GC Makers Web Application
#### Version 0.0.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Georgian College Makers club is a group of like minded students interested in making **'cool' stuff**. That term is purposely vague - whether it be the newest technological advancement in a developing industry, a simple desktop application, or perhaps a 3D printed robotic arm.. the Makers are interested!
> This repository is a WIP (work in progress) and contains the most recent and ongoing changes to the application. If you don't like **risk, instability, or even uncertainty** don't use our WIP application.
